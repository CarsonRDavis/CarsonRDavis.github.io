        Most of today has been spent reading more of the research papers we found. I also wrote part of the
        features report which includes what features we would be looking to use.

        Today we found and read through the abstracts of all of the research papers we found yesterday. We
        then searched for and found 2 potential malware datasets that we could use. Lastly, we set up a java project
        that reads and extracts apk files.

        This is the first real day of research. We have created an annotated bibliography of
        articles we plan to use for our research. We are going to read them and make sure they are
        all relavent to our topic. We have also began looking into how to open and read APK files.
