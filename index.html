    <h3>June 12th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Today, we went and finished writing a summary for all the papers in our annotated bibliography. We have
        also started updating our features report with a bulleted list for each type of feature we plan to use.
        We also have a meeting with Dr.Chouchane to receive the hard drive with all the samples we are going to updates
        and to have him look over all of our work so far.
    </p>

    <h3>June 11th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Today, all we did was go through our reference list, and write a brief summary about each article underneath the
        article to turn it into an annotated bibliography
    </p>

    <h3>June 10th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Today we spent most of the day practicing our android developement by trying to make a timer using threads. We
        also started creating an outline for our final paper. Lastly, we held a meeting with Dr.Chouchane to discuss the
        what he wants from our reports and to get the malaicious app samples.
    </p>

    <h3>June 6th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Most of today has been spent reading more of the research papers we found. I also wrote part of the
        features report which includes what features we would be looking to use.
    </p>

    <h3>June 5th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Today we found and read through the abstracts of all of the research papers we found yesterday. We
        then searched for and found 2 potential malware datasets that we could use. Lastly, we set up a java project
        that reads and extracts apk files.
    </p>

    <h3>June 4th, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        This is the first real day of research. We have created an annotated bibliography of
        articles we plan to use for our research. We are going to read them and make sure they are
        all relavent to our topic. We have also began looking into how to open and read APK files.
